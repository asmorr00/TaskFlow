# Floatier Task Management App - Summary

## Overview
Floatier is a modern, React-based task management application built with TypeScript that provides an intuitive interface for organizing and tracking tasks with subtasks. The app emphasizes visual organization, flexible viewing modes, and a focus system to help users manage complex projects effectively.

## Current State & Architecture

### **Technology Stack**
- **Frontend Framework**: React 18 with TypeScript
- **Build Tool**: Vite 5.1.4
- **Styling**: Tailwind CSS with dark mode support
- **UI Components**: Custom components built on Radix UI primitives
- **Animations**: Framer Motion for smooth transitions and interactions
- **State Management**: React hooks with localStorage persistence
- **Backend Preparation**: Supabase client setup (database not yet implemented)

```

## Core Features

### **1. Task Management**
- **Task Creation**: Full-featured dialog with title, description, priority, status, and subtasks
- **Task Editing**: Comprehensive editing capabilities for all task properties
- **Task Operations**: Duplicate, delete, and batch operations
- **Subtask Management**: Nested subtasks with individual completion tracking
- **Priority Levels**: Urgent, High, Medium, Low with visual indicators
- **Status Tracking**: Todo, In Progress, Review, Done workflow

### **2. Visual Organization**
- **Dual View Modes**: 
  - Grid view: Card-based layout optimized for visual scanning
  - List view: Horizontal layout with detailed information display
- **Drag & Drop**: Reorder tasks by dragging (preserves manual ordering)
- **Focus System**: 
  - Individual task focus toggle
  - Focus mode to show only selected tasks
  - Visual blur effect for unfocused tasks

### **3. Filtering & Search**
- **Text Search**: Real-time search across task titles and descriptions
- **Priority Filtering**: Filter by priority level or show all
- **Status Filtering**: Filter by workflow status or show all
- **Sort Options**: By creation date, update date, priority, status, or title
- **Filter Persistence**: Maintains user selections during session

### **4. User Experience**
- **Dark/Light Theme**: System-aware theme with manual toggle
- **Responsive Design**: Mobile-first approach with breakpoint optimizations
- **Animations**: Smooth transitions using Framer Motion
- **Local Persistence**: All data stored in localStorage
- **Error Boundary**: Graceful error handling

## Data Models

### **Task Structure**
```typescript
interface Task {
  id: string
  title: string
  description: string
  priority: 'urgent' | 'high' | 'medium' | 'low'
  status: 'todo' | 'in-progress' | 'review' | 'done'
  subtasks: Subtask[]
  isFocused: boolean
  createdAt: Date
  updatedAt: Date
}

interface Subtask {
  id: string
  name: string
  description: string
  completed: boolean
}
```

### **Database Schema (Prepared)**
The app includes a Supabase schema for future backend integration:
- **tasks** table: Core task data with user relationships
- **subtasks** table: Nested subtasks linked to parent tasks
- **profiles** table: User profile management
- Type-safe database interface with TypeScript

## Current Development Status

### **Completed Features** ✅
- Full task CRUD operations
- Subtask management with batch operations
- Dual view modes (grid/list)
- Comprehensive filtering and sorting
- Drag & drop reordering
- Focus system for task prioritization
- Dark/light theme support
- Responsive design across devices
- Local data persistence
- Rich UI with animations

### **Prepared but Not Active** ⚠️
- **Supabase Integration**: Client configured but not connected
- **User Authentication**: Schema prepared but not implemented
- **Cloud Synchronization**: Database types defined but not used

### **Sample Data**
The app currently loads with two sample tasks:
1. "Website Redesign" (High priority, In Progress)
2. "Mobile App" (Urgent priority, In Progress)

Each includes multiple subtasks demonstrating the full feature set.

## Technical Highlights

### **Performance Optimizations**
- Memoized filtering and sorting operations
- Efficient drag & drop state management
- Conditional rendering for large subtask lists
- Lazy loading of UI components

### **Accessibility Features**
- Semantic HTML structure
- Keyboard navigation support
- Focus management in modals
- Screen reader friendly labels

### **Code Quality**
- TypeScript for type safety
- Component composition pattern
- Custom hooks for reusable logic
- Consistent file organization
- Error boundary implementation

## Development Environment
- **Node.js**: Modern JavaScript runtime
- **Package Manager**: npm with lock file
- **Development Server**: Vite dev server with hot reloading
- **Linting**: ESLint with TypeScript support
- **Build Process**: TypeScript compilation + Vite bundling

## Next Steps for Production
1. **Backend Integration**: Activate Supabase connection
2. **User Authentication**: Implement sign-up/sign-in flow
3. **Data Migration**: Move from localStorage to cloud database
4. **User Management**: Multi-user support with data isolation
5. **Real-time Updates**: WebSocket integration for collaborative features
6. **Enhanced Features**: Due dates, attachments, team collaboration

## Summary
Floatier represents a well-architected, feature-complete task management application with a strong foundation for both individual productivity and future team collaboration. The codebase demonstrates modern React patterns, excellent TypeScript usage, and thoughtful UX design with a clear path to production deployment.
