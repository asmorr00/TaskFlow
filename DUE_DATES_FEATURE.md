# Due Dates Feature Implementation

## Overview
Successfully added due dates functionality to the Floatier task management application.

## What Was Added

### 1. Database Schema
- Added `due_date` column (nullable timestamp) to the tasks table
- Created indexes for performance optimization
- Migration file: `/supabase/migrations/add_due_date_to_tasks.sql`

### 2. Type Definitions
- Updated `Task` interface to include `due_date: string | null`
- Updated database types for Row, Insert, and Update operations
- Added new filter and sort options for due dates

### 3. Date Utilities
- Created `/lib/date-utils.ts` with helper functions:
  - `getDueDateStatus()` - Determines if a task is overdue, due today, tomorrow, this week, or upcoming
  - `getDueDateColor()` and `getDueDateBgColor()` - Returns appropriate colors for status indicators
  - `formatDueDate()` and `formatDueDateShort()` - Formats dates for display

### 4. UI Components

#### Create/Edit Task Dialogs
- Added date picker using the existing Calendar component
- Users can select a due date or clear it
- Integrated with react-day-picker via shadcn/ui

#### Task Cards
- Display due date badge with color-coded status:
  - Red: Overdue
  - Orange: Due today
  - Amber: Due tomorrow
  - Yellow: Due this week
  - Blue: Upcoming (more than a week away)

#### Filter Toolbar
- Added due date filter dropdown with options:
  - All Due Dates
  - Overdue
  - Due Today
  - Due This Week
  - Has Due Date
  - No Due Date
- Added "Due Date (Soonest First)" sort option

### 5. Filter & Sort Logic
- Updated `TaskGrid` component to handle due date filtering
- Implemented sorting by due date (tasks without due dates appear last)
- Integrated with existing filter/sort system

## How to Use

### Setting Due Dates
1. When creating a new task, click "Select due date" to open the date picker
2. Choose a date from the calendar
3. To remove a due date, click "Clear due date" in the calendar popup

### Filtering by Due Date
1. Use the "Due Date" dropdown in the filter toolbar
2. Select from predefined options like "Overdue" or "Due Today"
3. Combine with other filters (priority, status, search)

### Sorting by Due Date
1. Select "Due Date (Soonest First)" from the Sort dropdown
2. Tasks will be ordered by due date, with overdue tasks first
3. Tasks without due dates appear at the end

## Technical Details

- Dates are stored as UTC timestamps in the database
- Displayed in the user's local timezone
- The feature is fully integrated with existing dark mode and responsive design
- All components follow the existing Tailwind CSS styling patterns

## Migration Instructions

To apply the database changes to your Supabase instance:

1. Run the migration SQL file in your Supabase SQL editor:
   ```sql
   -- Add due_date column to tasks table
   ALTER TABLE tasks 
   ADD COLUMN due_date TIMESTAMP WITH TIME ZONE;

   -- Create indexes for performance
   CREATE INDEX idx_tasks_due_date ON tasks(due_date);
   CREATE INDEX idx_tasks_user_due_date ON tasks(user_id, due_date);
   ```

2. The application will automatically handle the new field once the database is updated

## Dependencies
- `date-fns` - Already included for date formatting and calculations
- `react-day-picker` - Already included via shadcn/ui Calendar component

No additional dependencies were required.
